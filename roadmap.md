It looks like I can’t directly open that GitHub link, but I can still break down **how to develop your DEADLOCK-NETWORK project within one year** — based on your past context and its core values: **user-friendly tech, integrity, and investor-centric design.**

Here’s a **strategic 12-month roadmap** built for serious execution and scaling:

---

## ⚙️ DEADLOCK-NETWORK — 1-Year Development Roadmap

### 🎯 Core Mission

Build a decentralized AI-powered blockchain ecosystem that:

* **Simplifies** complex decentralized tech for users
* **Maintains transparency and ethical integrity** in governance
* **Empowers investors** through sustainable tokenomics and real utility

---

## 🗓️ Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Foundation & Architecture

### Goals

* Finalize **technical architecture** (blockchain layer, AI layer, and API layer)
* Define **modular subprojects** (CLI, DApp UI, API core, AI engine)
* Establish **governance and tokenomics models**

### Actions

* ✅ Create system design doc outlining how DQN + blockchain integration works
* ✅ Define repo structure:

  * `/core/` — blockchain + validator logic
  * `/ai/` — reinforcement learning & model training
  * `/frontend/` — web + mobile clients
  * `/tools/` — CLI and SDK utilities
* ✅ Build foundational smart contracts (token, staking, and governance)
* ✅ Write whitepaper and investor-focused docs

### Deliverables

* Deadsgold Token v1 deployed (testnet)
* Architecture finalized and published
* Whitepaper v1 released

---

## 🧠 Phase 2 (Months 3–4): AI & Reinforcement Layer (DQN Core)

### Goals

* Implement and integrate Deep Q-Network-based **decision engine**
* Connect to blockchain for adaptive mining and dynamic difficulty
* Begin creating a **data feedback loop** for self-improvement

### Actions

* Implement `CustomAlgorithmCore` → reinforcement logic with on-chain triggers
* Create RL training environment for token performance optimization
* Simulate on testnet transactions + block reward learning

### Deliverables

* Prototype DQN module with blockchain reward feedback
* Benchmark metrics on adaptive mining
* Developer documentation for AI integration

---

## 🔗 Phase 3 (Months 5–6): On-Chain Infrastructure

### Goals

* Deploy full smart contract suite
* Build **bridge between AI engine and Solana RPC/CLI tools**
* Launch **validator and miner node software**

### Actions

* Integrate Solana-based contract calls via `@solana/web3.js` + Python wrappers
* Create mining reward distribution smart contract
* Build REST API for analytics + transaction tracking

### Deliverables

* Mainnet-ready token contracts
* Mining node prototype
* Backend API v1

---

## 🌐 Phase 4 (Months 7–8): Frontend & User Experience

### Goals

* Design highly **user-friendly DApp dashboard**
* Allow investors and users to **stake, trade, and monitor AI metrics**
* Ensure transparency through blockchain visualizations

### Actions

* Build with React + Tailwind + ShadCN (modern clean interface)
* Integrate wallet connection (Phantom, Solflare)
* Add real-time stats (token value, AI model performance, chain activity)

### Deliverables

* DApp MVP online
* Phantom-compatible wallet integration
* Investor dashboard

---

## 💰 Phase 5 (Months 9–10): Investor Systems & Launch Prep

### Goals

* Create **staking pools**, **NFT access keys**, and **investor portals**
* Audit all smart contracts
* Prepare for **mainnet launch + listing**

### Actions

* Launch staking contract
* Conduct community beta with 100+ testers
* Begin partnerships and pre-launch marketing
* Perform audit with CertiK or equivalent

### Deliverables

* Public testnet
* Audited smart contracts
* Pre-launch investor deck

---

## 🚀 Phase 6 (Months 11–12): Public Launch & Scaling

### Goals

* Launch **mainnet**
* Begin **trading on Raydium / Jupiter**
* Start continuous AI learning cycles and expansion roadmap

### Actions

* Mainnet deploy of DApp and token
* Launch marketing campaign
* Start governance DAO rollout
* Prepare Deadsgold AI v2 research (next iteration of DQN)

### Deliverables

* Official Launch
* Token listing
* Investor portal live
* Roadmap for Year 2 (expansion + new utilities)

## 🔑 Key Principles to Uphold

| Core Value            | Implementation                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User-Friendliness** | Simple UX, low gas fees, intuitive CLI/UI                       |
| **Integrity**         | Public audits, transparent governance, open-source AI logic     |
| **Investor Focus**    | Yield pools, AI-backed performance reports, transparent returns |

Would you like me to **expand this into a full GitHub project plan**, including repository structure, directory map, and milestone issues (like a professional open-source roadmap)? That would turn this outline into a concrete 12-month actionable engineering plan.
