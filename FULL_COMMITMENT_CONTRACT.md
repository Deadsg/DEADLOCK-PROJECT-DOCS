## 🔄 **Part IV — Revival and Integration of the Pump.fun Coin**

Recognizing the legacy and potential of the **Pump.fun coin**, **DEADSGOLD** commits to its **revival and reintegration** into a sustainable ecosystem.  

### 🎯 **Purpose**
To transform the Pump.fun coin from a speculative relic into a functional and rewarding element of the DEADLOCK-NETWORK — empowering both old holders and new participants.  

### 🧩 **Integration Strategy**
1. 💎 **Holder Rewards:** Existing Pump.fun holders will receive proportional DEADSGOLD airdrops or bonus yields.  
2. ⚒️ **Mining Incentives:** The Pump.fun token will act as a **secondary mining reward**, distributed periodically alongside DEADSGOLD emissions.  
3. 💧 **Liquidity Restoration:** Strategic liquidity pool creation will ensure the Pump.fun coin regains market viability and purpose.  
4. 🔗 **Technical Linkage:** Smart contracts will automatically pair both assets in yield events, fostering mutual growth.  

Through this, DEADSGOLD ensures **revival through utility**, not speculation — honoring the past while building forward.
