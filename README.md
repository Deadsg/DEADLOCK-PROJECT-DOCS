## ⚙️ Project Plan: DEADLOCK-NETWORK (Solfunmeme Repo)

### 🎯 Core Mission

Evolve the `solfunmeme` repository into a decentralized AI-powered blockchain ecosystem that simplifies decentralized tech, maintains transparency, and empowers investors.

### 🏗️ Proposed Repository Structure (Monorepo)

To accommodate the full scope of the project (frontend, blockchain, AI), we will restructure the repository into a monorepo.

```
/
├── packages/
│   ├── frontend/      # Your existing Next.js app will be moved here
│   ├── core/          # Solana smart contracts (Rust/Anchor)
│   ├── ai/            # AI/DQN models and logic (Python/Node.js)
│   └── api/           # Backend REST API for analytics
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   └── whitepaper.md
├── PROJECT_PLAN.md    # This file
└── package.json       # Root package.json for managing workspaces
```

## 🗓️ Phase 1 (Months 1–2): Foundation & Repo Restructuring

**Goal:** Reorganize the codebase into a scalable monorepo and define the core architecture.

**Actions:**

1.  **Restructure the Repository:**
    *   Create a `packages` directory.
    *   Move the entire existing Next.js application into `packages/frontend`.
    *   Create placeholder directories: `packages/core`, `packages/ai`, and `packages/api`.
2.  **Establish Monorepo Management:**
    *   Create a root `package.json` to manage the project workspaces (using pnpm, yarn, or npm).
3.  **Define Architecture:**
    *   Create `docs/architecture.md` to outline the technical design, detailing how the `frontend`, `api`, `ai`, and `core` packages will interact.
    *   Create `docs/whitepaper.md` to formalize the project's goals, tokenomics, and value proposition.

## 🧠 Phase 2 (Months 3–4): Core Logic & On-Chain Development

**Goal:** Build the foundational smart contracts and the AI engine's prototype.

**Actions:**

1.  **Develop Smart Contracts (`packages/core`):**
    *   Set up a new Anchor project within `packages/core`.
    *   Implement the initial smart contracts for the Deadsgold Token (SPL Token), staking logic, and a basic governance model.
2.  **Prototype AI Engine (`packages/ai`):**
    *   Set up a Python or Node.js project.
    *   Implement the core DQN algorithm (`CustomAlgorithmCore`).
    *   Create a simulated environment to test the reinforcement learning model against blockchain data (e.g., transaction volume, price action).

---

## 🔗 Phase 3 (Months 5–6): Backend API & Integration

**Goal:** Create a bridge between the frontend, the AI engine, and the on-chain programs.

**Actions:**

1.  **Build Backend (`packages/api`):**
    *   Develop a REST API (e.g., using Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
    *   Create endpoints to serve analytics, track transactions, and provide data from the AI engine to the frontend.
2.  **Integrate Solana (`packages/frontend`):**
    *   Add Solana dependencies to the frontend app: `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`.
    *   Develop a service layer or utility functions in the frontend to communicate with your smart contracts and the new API.

---

## 🌐 Phase 4 (Months 7–8): DApp Frontend & UX

**Goal:** Transform the existing website into a functional, user-friendly DApp for investors.

**Actions:**

1.  **Implement Wallet Connectivity (`packages/frontend`):**
    *   Integrate a "Connect Wallet" button into the `src/components/Header/index.tsx` component using the Solana Wallet Adapter.
    *   Wrap the application in `WalletProvider` inside `src/app/providers.tsx`.
2.  **Build the Investor Dashboard:**
    *   Convert the current homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`) into the main DApp dashboard.
    *   Create new React components for key DApp functions:
        *   `src/components/Dashboard/` - To display user balances, staking rewards, and AI performance metrics.
        *   `src/components/Staking/` - UI for staking and unstaking tokens.
        *   `src/components/Governance/` - UI for viewing and voting on proposals.
3.  **Connect UI to Backend:**
    *   Wireframe the new components to fetch data from your `packages/api` and interact directly with the Solana blockchain for transactions.

## 💰 Phase 5 (Months 9–10): Investor Systems & Testing

**Goal:** Finalize investor-facing features, audit contracts, and prepare for launch.

**Actions:**

1.  **Launch Staking Pools:**
    *   Deploy the staking smart contract to the Solana devnet.
    *   Connect the `src/components/Staking/` UI to the devnet contract for public testing.
2.  **Smart Contract Audit:**
    *   Perform a comprehensive audit of all contracts in `packages/core`.
    *   Document findings and apply necessary fixes.
3.  **Community Beta:**
    *   Deploy the full DApp to a public URL (e.g., using Vercel) connected to the devnet.
    *   Invite community members to test functionality and provide feedback.

---

## 🚀 Phase 6 (Months 11–12): Mainnet Launch & Scaling

**Goal:** Launch the project publicly and begin post-launch operations.

**Actions:**

1.  **Mainnet Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the finalized and audited smart contracts to the Solana mainnet.
    *   Deploy the DApp and API to production environments.
    *   Update the frontend to point to mainnet contracts.
2.  **Liquidity & Trading:**
    *   Create a liquidity pool on a Solana DEX (like Raydium or Jupiter).
3.  **Governance & Roadmap V2:**
    *   Initiate the first governance proposals through the DApp.
    *   Publish the roadmap for the second year, focusing on AI model improvements and ecosystem expansion.
