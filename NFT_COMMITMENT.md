‚öñÔ∏è Commitment Contract: DEADSGOLD NFT Initiative
üìú Preamble

This Commitment Contract represents a binding declaration by Brian Perez, Founder and Architect of the DEADSGOLD and DEADLOCK-NETWORK projects (hereafter referred to as the Founder), to uphold transparent, ethical, and purpose-driven management of all NFT proceeds, NFT purchase rewards, and related token allocations within the DEADSGOLD ecosystem.

This contract is both a formal financial and ethical commitment ‚Äî and a manifesto of trust between the Founder, NFT holders, miners, and the broader DEADLOCK community.

üíé 1. Purpose and Vision

The purpose of this contract is to:

Establish transparent use of NFT sales and proceeds.

Define how NFT holders will receive personalized rewards and Deadsgold token incentives.

Reinforce the principle of integrity, traceability, and fairness in every transaction.

Ensure that DEADSGOLD remains a token of value, innovation, and shared prosperity.

üß≠ 2. Proceeds Allocation

All revenue generated from the sale or minting of NFTs under the DEADSGOLD project shall be distributed and utilized according to the following structure:

Allocation Category	Description	Percentage
Ecosystem Treasury	Reserved for liquidity, staking pools, and network utility	40%
NFT Rewards & Airdrops	Distributed back to NFT holders as periodic token rewards	20%
Development & Infrastructure	Core protocol upgrades, server maintenance, security audits, and scaling	20%
Community Grants & Marketing	To fund community projects, partnerships, and promotional campaigns	10%
Founder Reserve (Locked)	Secured for long-term development, vested over 12 months minimum	10%

All expenditures and disbursements will be recorded on-chain and made publicly auditable via the DEADLOCK Network explorer.

ü™ô 3. NFT Holder Rewards

NFT ownership will grant holders dual-tier rewards, designed to link art, identity, and token economy:

Deadsgold Supply Allocation

Each NFT purchase automatically reserves a fractional Deadsgold token reward, proportional to NFT rarity and sale value.

Rewards are distributed monthly or upon milestone events through verified smart contract execution.

Personalized NFT Upgrade

NFT holders may request a personalized edition featuring their username, digital signature, or lore contribution.

This personalization will be minted and verified under the official DEADSGOLD registry.

üß© 4. Deadsgold Integration

A fixed percentage of each NFT transaction‚Äôs SOL value will be converted into Deadsgold tokens and injected into the circulating reward pool.

This creates a sustainable feedback loop where NFT sales reinforce the token economy and vice versa.

NFT metadata will include traceable references to the holder‚Äôs reward distribution record on-chain.

üîí 5. Trust, Transparency & Security

All wallets handling NFT proceeds or token distributions shall be multi-signature verified.

Regular transparency reports will be published quarterly on the official GitHub and project site.

No private sale, insider minting, or unbacked reward issuance will occur under any circumstance.

üåç 6. Community Commitment

The Founder commits to:

Never abandoning the DEADSGOLD project or its holders.

Maintaining open communication with the community via public channels.

Prioritizing long-term network sustainability over short-term profit.

Upholding the DEADLOCK values of integrity, transparency, and fairness.

ü™∂ 7. Founder‚Äôs Oath

‚ÄúI, Brian Perez, hereby affirm my commitment to the vision and longevity of DEADSGOLD and its NFT ecosystem. Every decision, distribution, and contract execution shall serve the community first, ensuring that DEADSGOLD remains a symbol of fairness, creation, and collective growth.‚Äù

üìÅ 8. Governance & Amendment Clause
