6-Month LLC Rollout Plan (Massachusetts)

Below is a month-by-month plan, with tasks, checkpoints, and where your savings are targeted toward costs and foundations. Since you already have tech/hackathon/AI experience, you can parallel your business-system work while forming the LLC.

Month	Key Focus	Tasks & Notes	Approximate Cost / Savings Use
Month 1	Preparatory phase	• Brainstorm and finalize business concept (your AI system, tool-use agents, etc)
• Choose a business name that works for your branding
• Run a name-search in Massachusetts to check availability
• Reserve the name (optional)
• Outline your operating model: what the LLC will do (products/services)
• Open a dedicated savings bucket for LLC formation costs (<– you already are)	Name‐reservation fee if you do it (~$30)

• Allocate from your $2,700 savings to ensure you cover any upcoming costs (for example annual report fee) and build working capital.	At end of Month 6 you’ve saved $2,700. Use part to ensure you’re prepared for the upcoming recurring and unexpected costs.

Budget Overview & How Your Savings Help

Filing fee (~$500) will be covered in Month 3 from your savings.

Additional costs (business bank account, possibly registered agent service, website/domain, marketing, licenses) should be drawn from your monthly $450 savings as you go.

By Month 6 you have $2,700 saved — you’ll have used perhaps $600-$1,000 in formation and initial launch. Remaining $1,700-$2,100 becomes your working capital buffer for the first year of operation.

Given Massachusetts’ high annual report fee (~$500) you should reserve part of your savings for that upcoming obligation.
